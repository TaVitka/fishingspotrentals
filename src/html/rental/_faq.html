          Are there any restrictions on where I can use the rented equipment?

          <p>
            Our rented equipment can be used in a variety of fishing environments, but we recommend checking any local
            fishing regulations in the area you plan to visit. Some regions may have specific rules about the type of
            equipment and bait that can be used.
